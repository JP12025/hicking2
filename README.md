# What to Do

You have to solve [Day 10 of the Advent of Code 2024 **Part 2**](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/10). First, you need to solve Part 1 to reveal the text of Part2. Then, adapt your code from Part 1 to solve Part 2. So, keep an open mind and think different.

The problem is protected by Copyright, in consequence we cannot copy it here and you have to read the linked website and understand the problem. You **need** to connect to Advent of Code to solve Part 1.

You have to implement your solution in a file named `hicking2.py` which takes only one argument : the file name that contains the puzzle input. Tests are given through the `check` script as usual.

Your program should print the number of distinct hicking trails asked in **Part 2** of the problem. Like in the examples given below.
